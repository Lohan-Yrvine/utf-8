# UTF-8 encoder/decoder

A simple UTF-8 encoder and decoder.

## Motivation

I did this as a start project of learning deeper how systems programming works,
since it is something that really gets my attention.

## Learnings

With this project I could understand how UTF-8's treatment are under the hood,
got a better understanding of how C strings work and created my first Makefile.

## References

I used only this [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) article from
Wikipedia to see how the encoding is made, and to the decoding, I just used
the reverse logic.

## Build it yourself

If you want try it on your machine, you can use the following commands:

To clone the repo and get inside it:
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/Lohan-Yrvine/utf-8
cd utf-8
```

To only compile the program:
```zsh
make
```

To run (and compile, if needed):
```zsh
make run
```

To clean the executable and object files:
```zsh
make clean
```
